Learn how to:
- tune training hyperparameters for better model performance
- optimise reward functions for faster learning
- get results in a couple of hours of training, and for free (i also don't own any GPUs)

## Tutorials

## Notes
* Most of these results can be achieved in a few hours of GPU training. Sometimes less. And for free on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) (30h per week usage limit)
* Notebooks originally adapted from [Mujoco's MJX tutorial](https://colab.research.google.com/github/google-deepmind/mujoco/blob/main/mjx/tutorial.ipynb)
